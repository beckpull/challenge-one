# Horiseon Website - Search Engine Optimization
This project consisted of refactoring and reorganizing the codebase to this webpage in order to make it more accessible and to optimize search engine compatibilty.

## User Story
As a marketing agency, we wanted to create a codebase that is optimized for search engines and accessibilty features - and then, we wanted to share it with the world! Horiseon aims to ease the burden of refactoring and reorganizing codebases and provide our customers with a clean, polished result; without changing the appearance/functionality that currently exists.

## Technologies 
This website utlizes semantic HTML structures combined with CSS styling in order to create a beautiful landing page for those looking to optimize their own websites in a similar fashion!
